# 👋 Hello, I'm PtitCalin!

🌱 New to the Dev scenem I'm a creative experimenter, and lifelong learner, currently building the **Awesome Test Vault** — a digital playground for structured growth, learning, and second-brain system design.

🔭 Right now, I'm focused on:
- Building modular learning systems inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- Designing dynamic templates, workflows, and knowledge management structures
- Exploring scripting languages, automation, and creativity workflows

🎯 I'm learning in public, sharing my process, and growing my vault **one experiment at a time**.
