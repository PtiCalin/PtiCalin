  <p><strong>Building modular knowledge systems, developer tooling, and creative automation — learning in public with disciplined iteration.</strong></p>
</div>

## Overview
I explore the intersection of personal knowledge systems, scripting, and creative engineering. My current focus: evolving an extensible Obsidian-based stack (VaultOS + Awesome Test Vault) to prototype structured thinking, automated organization, and reproducible workflows.

## Current Focus
- VaultOS: plugin orchestration, validation, and structured vault automation.
- Awesome Test Vault: experimental second-brain patterns & modular templates.
- Tooling experiments in Rust, Python & TypeScript for automation and content ops.
- Systems thinking applied to worldbuilding, game design, and data curation.

<summary><strong>Extended Notes (click to expand)</strong></summary>

- <strong>Vault Architecture:</strong> Emphasis on declarative metadata, validation layers, and reproducible knowledge flows.
- <strong>Experiment Rhythm:</strong> Small scope → measured outcome → refactor → document pattern.
- <strong>Design Drivers:</strong> Maintainability, transparency, portability, low cognitive load.
- <strong>Learning Style:</strong> Build-first, synthesize later. Prefer real artifacts over speculative diagrams.

### UNCHAINED

Local-first, privacy-respecting music library + DJ studio designed to work offline, then scale to the web without rewrites.

<details>
<summary><strong>Quick Start (Phase 1)</strong></summary>

Backend setup (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-dev.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run-backend.ps1
# Health check
Start-Process http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

- Env Vars (backend `config/.env`): `API_HOST`, `API_PORT`.
- Env Vars (frontend optional): `VITE_API_BASE`, `VITE_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS`.

Repository layout:
```
backend/       # FastAPI app, services, models
library/       # Audio, covers, metadata, db
frontend/      # React + Tailwind + Tauri
config/        # .env, settings.json
scripts/       # Helper scripts
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Metadata & Sources Workflow</strong></summary>

Supported source imports (legal use only): Spotify (metadata/playlists), iTunes XML, Bandcamp (authorized URLs), MusicBrainz, Discogs, SoundCloud (public metadata), local folder scans.

Quality aggregation:
```powershell
$Body = @{ artist = "Boards of Canada"; album = "Music Has the Right"; title = "Roygbiv"; path_audio = "library/audio/roygbiv.flac" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $Body -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/sources/metadata/quality
```
Apply candidate:
```powershell
$Apply = @{ candidate_id = 12; track_id = 5 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $Apply -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/sources/metadata/apply
```
Revert field:
```powershell
$Revert = @{ track_id = 5; field_name = "album" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body $Revert -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/sources/metadata/revert
```

Artwork variants & relations endpoints also support multiple covers and semantic track links (`remix`, `edit`, `alternate_version`, `sample_of`, `part_of_release`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Performance Features</strong></summary>

- Samples: time-ranged slices for pads (`/sources/tracks/{id}/samples`).
- Multiple artwork variants per track.
- Relations: remix/edit/version/sample linking.
- SSE Events: `/sources/events/stream` for real-time notifications (upload_complete, download_finished).
- Desktop integration: system tray actions, toast host, update status.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>UI Modes & Layout</strong></summary>

Modes: Player, Library, Collection, Focus, Dashboard, Studio.
Core shell components: `AppShell.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `BottomPlayer.tsx`.
Global state: `useAppStore.ts` (Zustand). Notifications: `services/notifications.ts` (SSE bootstrap).
Interaction rules: click = open, double-click = play, space = play/pause, Ctrl/Cmd+F = search, drag files = import.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vision & Roadmap</strong></summary>

Phases: Foundation → Analysis → UI Modes → Data Science → DJ Engine → Mixing Suite → Web Deployment.
Long-term: Local-first extensibility + optional cloud sync; provenance-aware metadata with reversible attribution; modular analysis engine (Librosa → Essentia).

### Awesome Test Vault + VaultOS

Your brain deserves an operating system — this is it. A modular, automation-powered PKM stack where Obsidian is the interface, VaultOS is the orchestration engine, and subplugins + scripts keep everything consistent, queryable, and alive.

<details>
<summary><strong>What It Actually Is</strong></summary>

- **Awesome Test Vault:** Beautifully overengineered knowledge base (notes, templates, dashboards).
- **VaultOS:** Orchestration engine that validates metadata and automates structure.
- **VaultOS Subplugins:** Small focused modules for file sorting, dashboards, middleware, worldbuilding, developer tooling.
- **Python & Node scripts:** Indexing, refactors, batch operations (the vault elves).
- **Metadata schemas:** Declarative rules and IDs; YAML-first for transparency.
- **Dashboards:** Status and insights that make the vault feel organized.

Local-first, script-enhanced, metadata-driven, automation-powered. Also: a cozy intellectual living room.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why This Exists</strong></summary>

Manual note management doesn’t scale. This system:
- Builds folders and creates templates on demand.
- Enforces metadata standards with a gentle librarian vibe.
- Logs state automatically and keeps dashboards fresh.
- Lets you focus on thinking while the structure stays tidy.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Architecture (Human Version)</strong></summary>

1) **Interface Layer (Obsidian):** Write, plan, worldbuild, learn.  
2) **Logic Layer (VaultOS):** Intercepts events and keeps metadata, folders, and dashboards aligned.  
3) **Backend Layer (Scripts):** Python/Node indexing, refactors, batch ops running quietly in the background.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Subplugin Ecosystem</strong></summary>

- `backend/`: file sorting, metadata fixing, ID assignment, YAML validation.
- `frontend/`: dashboards, widgets, control panels.
- `middleware/`: bridge between Obsidian events and scripts.
- `worldbuilding/`: structures for characters, timelines, maps, lore.
- `developer/`: helpers, snippets, polyglot tools.

Think Pokémon, but for automations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Roadmap</strong></summary>

Phase 1 — Stabilize: core plugin, control panel, presets, metadata engine, baseline automations.  
Phase 2 — Smarter: autosort v2, full indexer, auto-summaries, smart tagger, YAML refactor tools.  
Phase 3 — UI Polish: dashboards, visual metadata inspector, interactive panels.  
Phase 4 — Polyglot: expand modules (R, Lua, Elixir, Rust).  
Phase 5 — Worldbuilding Engine: story blocks, character builder, alignment web, memory logs, GM mode.  
Phase 6 — Cloud Magic: subplugin registry, auto-updates, migration toolkit, installer wizard.  
Phase 7 — Release: docs, demos, marketing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Who Is This For</strong></summary>

- Builders who turn “a few notes” into micro-civilizations.
- Developers who automate to avoid repetitive work.
- Worldbuilders who want lore to behave like a database.
- Productivity folks and chaos gremlins alike.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Final Vibe Check</strong></summary>

It’s a living system, a toolbelt, a learning lab, and a dev playground. Clone it, break it, extend it. Let it organize itself—and yes, judge your metadata (gently).
